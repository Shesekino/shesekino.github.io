### Study Groups

There's a concept I'm experimenting with around *study groups*. Study groups are structured similarly to task forces, but completely differ in their purpose. Where a task force aims to deliver software, a study group aims to gather and deliver knowledge.

In modern organisations that (rightfully) showcase incremental, agile software delivery, a group of people with goals purely on studying may seem like an aberration at first. We're removing people from their teams for some period of time **and** not delivering software? Absolute madness.

One of the problems with incremental delivery during experimentation phases (often the case with task forces) is that once you get something working, you don't bother cleaning up - there'd be time for that "later". Even documentation for proper repeateability gets messy even if knowledge transfer is advertised as part of the task force's definition of done. A study group is less prone for such problems: Studying and fully understanding the necessary bits *are* their primary goals. Teaching the individual members' teams what they've learned is expected to be the first thing they do when the study group disbands.

Timelines are less of an issue as well for study groups. Since there's no working software to deliver, there's usually less unknowns to run into
