I am a curious software engineer with an eye for detail and a passion for owning my work end to end. I enjoy working independently as well as influencing, teaching and learning from my colleagues. I care about infrastructure as much as I care about backend development. I enjoy balancing incremental shipping of value to users while maintaining long term sustainability.

In recent years I've taken on the role of a software architect. Most of the time I know what I'm doing.
